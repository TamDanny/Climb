# Climb
A college final project of a game about climbing, heavily inspired by Celeste.

> *Currently in development and hopefully able to show off by the beginning of May*

## Controls (for now...)
* In the menu, use the arrow keys to select your option and press Enter to proceed. Right now, only the *Climb* option will work.
* Move left and right with the **arrow keys**. When climbing (described next), use up or down to ascend or descend the wall.
* Use the **spacebar** to jump. Jump normally on the ground, or perform a wall jump when next to a wall.
* When beside a wall, use the **C key** to climb. Climb up the wall to get over it, or position yourself for a better wall jump.
* Finally, the **X key** will allow you to boost a short time in any direction you want. You can only boost once in the air, but it will regenerate upon landing on the ground.

## As of now...
There are still elements left to implement, such as stamina, better traveling between areas, refinement in physics, pause menu and main menu, etc. For now, you will be in a 2-area level made for debugging purposes. Do what your heart desires (and what the bugs will desire to)! There's a load zone on the top of the first area, but you can't go back (so you'll have to restart the game to go back to the first room, sorry!).
Enjoy, I guess!
