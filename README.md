# Climb
A college final project of a game about climbing, heavily inspired by Celeste.

> *Currently in development and hopefully able to show off by the beginning of May*

### Credits
* Daniel Hern√°ndez
* Pedro Ontiveros
* Federico Alcereca
* Special thanks to [*Celeste*](http://www.celestegame.com/) for being the huge inspiration to this. This was just something fun to make, since I (Danny) really love this game.
