# Climb
A college final project of a game about climbing, heavily inspired by Celeste.

Made for our video games project course, the objective is to progress through a series of areas in a level to reach its end, all of which requires a bit of maneuvering to get to.

## Controls
* In the menu, use the **arrow keys** to select your option and press **Enter** to proceed. *Climb* will go to the level selection screen, where you can pick one of the two levels available to play through. *Credits* will display the people who worked on this, as well as some special thanks.
* Move left and right with the **arrow keys**. When climbing (described next), use up or down to ascend or descend the wall.
* Use the **spacebar** to jump. Jump normally on the ground, or perform a wall jump when next to a wall.
* When beside a wall, use the **C key** to climb. Climb up the wall to get over it, or position yourself for a better wall jump. *Stamina* will be used up when climbing, and you can no longer climb when it runs out. *Stamina* will recharge quickly when you're on the ground.
* Finally, the **X key** will allow you to boost a short time in any direction you want. You can only boost once in the air, but it will regenerate upon landing on the ground.

### The team
* Daniel Hern√°ndez (Leader, lead programmer, artist/animator)
* Pedro Ontiveros (Level designer, organizer)
* Federico Alcereca (Level designer, play tester)

### Special Thanks
* [*Celeste*](http://www.celestegame.com/) for being the huge inspiration to this. This was just something fun to make, since I (Danny) really love this game.
* [*Lena Raine*](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/) for the lovely music used in this project, made specifically for Celeste as well.

## What's next?
The game made specifically for school purposes is completed, even though there are tons of elements that we wanted to implement but couldn't due to lack of time (and the surplus of projects this semester).\
*However*, I want to develop this further in a different engine (since we were just learning bits of Java just to make this, & it'd be good to use something more specialized in game development). It will likely be a one-man project since the others don't plan on working on this more.\
It's gonna be a pet project on my backlog, but I have desires to continue working on a game like this. The entire purpose of this college project was to attempt to replicate a fully fledged game as the likes of Celeste. Even if that was extremely unlikely to achieve in the first place, I wanted to see how far I could go with this, along with my teammates. I'm left somewhat satisfied with the result, but I'd love to keep going.
